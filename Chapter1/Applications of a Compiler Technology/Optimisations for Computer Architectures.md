- Parallelism
	- instruction level: multiple operations executed simultaneously
	- processor level: different threads of the same application run on different processors.
- Memory Hierarchies
	- We cannot have storage that is both fast and large, it must only be either.



Parallelism:
---
- modern microprocesseors exploit instruction-level parallelism
- VLIW machines have instructions that can issue multiple operations in parallel.
- Programmers can write multithreaded ode for multiprocessors, or parallel code can be auto generated by a compiler from onventional sequential programs.



Memory Hierarchies:
---
- several levels of storage with different speeds and sizes.
- level closest to the processor being the fastest but smallest.
- average memory-access time of a program is reduced if most accesses are satisfied by the faster levels of the heirarchy.
- A processor usually has:
	- a small num of registers: hundreds of bytes
	- several levels of cache: kilobites to megabytes
	- physical memory: megabytes to gigabytes
	- secondary storage: gigabytes+
	- speed of accesses between adjacent levels can differ by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude.
- Using Registers effectively is the most important problem in optimizing a program.
- it is possible to improve the effectiveness of memory heirarchy by changing:
	- the layout of data
	- the order of instructions accessing the data
	- layout of code to improve the effectiveness of instruction caches.
