## ðŸš€ About
This repository contains all my exercise answers for each chapter as I read through the book **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools**.

This is an Obsidian Vault, hence for now it can only be opened with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application. 
I will reorganize and compress all exercise answers into a webpage when I complete my readings and study.
