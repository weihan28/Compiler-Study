## 🚀 About
This repository contains all my exercise answers or notes for each chapter as I read through the book **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools**.

This is an Obsidian Vault, hence for now it can only be opened with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application. 
I will reorganize and compile all exercise answers into a webpage when I complete my readings and study.

Required [Community Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins):
- [Excalidraw](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/excalidraw-full-featured-sketching-plugin-in-obsidian/17367)
