## ðŸš€ About
This repository contains all my exercise answers or notes for each chapter as I read through the book **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools**.

This is an Obsidian Vault, hence for now it can only be opened and viewed properly with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application. 
I will reorganize and compile all exercise answers into a webpage when I complete my readings and study.

My Goal is to aquire enough knowledge to grasp the inner workings of a compiler and to eventually create a new Language Compiler from scratch.
