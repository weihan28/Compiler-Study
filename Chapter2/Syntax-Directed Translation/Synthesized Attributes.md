Attributes can be evaluated as follows:
- for a given input string x, 
	- construct a parse tree for x
	- apply semantic rules to evaluate attributes aat each node in the parse tree.

Suppose a node N is labeled by the grammar symbol X. 
X.a is the value of the attribute a of X at that node.

**Annotated parse tree**:
	A parse tree showing the attribute values at each node.


- Annotated parse tree for 9-5+2 with attribute t associated with the nonterminals expr and term.

- An attribute is **synthesized** if its value at parse-tree node N is determined from attribute values at the children of N or at N itself.
- Synthesized attributes can be evaluated during a single *bottom-up traversal* of parse tree.



**Syntax-directed definition** that the annotated parse tree above is based on.

- The symbol || is the operator for string concatenation.
- Each nonterminal has a string attribute t that represents the postfix notation for the expression generated by that nonterminal in a parse tree.
- expr.t and expr1.t refers to the same nonterminal but different values. The subscript 1 is not part of its name.
