sample program:
![[Screenshot 2024-06-13 at 9.23.45 PM.png]]
```java
{ 
	// declarations of outer block
	int x; char y; 
	// statements of outer block
	// Note: a block is also a statement
	{ 
		// declarations of inner block
		bool y; 
		// statements of inner block
		x; 
		y; 
	} 
	x; 
	y; 
}
```

task to perform:
	print a revised program, in which the declarations have been removed and each statement" has its identier followed by a colon and its type.

goal to produce:

```java
{ 
	// Note: all declarations removed
	{ 
		// identifier and type of STATEMENTS of inner block
		x:int; 
		y:bool;  // type of y is bool
	} 
	// identifier and type of STATEMENTS of outer block
	x:int; 
	y:char;  // type of y is char
}
```
