process of determining how a string of terminals can be generated by grammar.


Recursive descent
---
used to parse and implement syntax-directed translators.

Yacc
---
a software tool to generate a translator directly from a translation scheme.


- for any CFG there is a parser that takes worst case O(n^3).
- Linear-time algorithms suffice to parse essentially(mostly) all languages in practise.
- Programming-language parsers almost always make a single left-to-right scan over the input, looking ahead one terminal at a time, constructing the parse tree as they go.


Parsing Methods
---
Order of construction of parse trees for each method:
- Top-down
	root -> leaves
	efficient parcers can be constructed easily by hand
- Bottom-up
	leaves -> root
	handles a larger class of grammar and translation shemes.
	commonly used in software tools for generating parsers directly from grammars.

Example:
	see [[Top-down parsing while scanning the input from left to right]] for the construction steps.

- Empty strings use special treatment
- Backtracking is needed if the production is unsuitable after using the production.
- Backtracking is not needed for [[Predictive Parsing]].
