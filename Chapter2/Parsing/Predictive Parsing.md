Recursive-descent parsing
---
A top-down method of syntax analysis in which a set of recursive procedures is used to process the input. 
One procedure is associated with each nonterminal of a grammar.

Predictive Parsing
--
A simple form of recursive-descent parsing. 
- the lookahead symbol unambiguously determines the flow of control through the procedure bode for each nonterminal.
- the sequence of procedure calls during analysis of an input string implicitly defines a parse tree for the input. It can be used to build an explicit parse tree if desired.
- relies on information about the first symbols that can be generated by a production body.



Let FIRST(A) be the set of terminals that appear as the fist symbols of one or more strings of terminals generated from A. If A is empty_str or can generate it then empty_str is also in FIRST(A).

Note: 
	if FIRST(n1) and FIRST(n2) is not disjoint, 
	we cannot determine which production we would want to use without potentially backtracking, which shouldn't happen in predictive parsing.

Example:
	A -> B
	A -> C
	B-> a E
	C -> a F
when at A, what production should A take when the lookahead symbol is a?
	For A -> B:
		FIRST(B)={a}
	For A -> C:
		FIRST(C)={a}
	There are more then 1 way, so we cant tell(predict) which is the correct path.
